"FCS","Fragile and conflict affected situations","Fragile and conflict affected situations","Fragile and conflict affected situations","F1","","Fragile and conflict affected situations aggregate. Countries with fragile situations are primarily International Development Association-eligible countries and nonmember or inactive countries and territories with a 3.2 or lower harmonized average of the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment rating and the corresponding rating by a regional development bank, or that have had a UN or regional peacebuilding and political mission (for example by the African Union, European Union, or Organization of American States) or peacekeeping mission (for example, by the African Union, European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or Organization of American States) during the last three years. The group excludes IBRD countries (for which the CPIA scores are not publically disclosed); unless there is the presence of a peace-keeping or political/peacebuilding mission. This definition is pursuant to an agreement between the World Bank and other multilateral development banks at the start of the International Development Association 15 round in 2007. The list of countries and territories with fragile situations is imperfect and used here to reflect a complex concept. The World Bank continues to work with partners and client countries to refine the concept.","","","F1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016",
